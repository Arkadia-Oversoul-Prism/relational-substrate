"""Deployment auth posture — the production guard must fail closed.

``AUTHORIZATION-BOUNDARY-01.md`` (AB-9) found the live host accepting unsigned
``alg:"none"`` JWTs. Direct inspection of the running process confirmed why:
``ENVIRONMENT`` and ``FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`` were both unset, so
``_init_firebase`` took the dev-mode branch and never verified signatures.

The code's production guard is correct — these tests pin that contract so it
cannot regress. They assert the *contract*, not the deployment: the deployment
is configured by its environment, which is verified operationally, not here.

Run each case in a subprocess so the module-level ``_init_firebase()`` call
re-executes against a controlled environment, isolated from the test process.
