"""
Arkadia Architecture — Layer Map
=================================
Canonical directory-to-layer assignments for the architecture fitness tests.
Update this file whenever a new subsystem or layer is added.

Referenced by: ADR-015, test_layer_boundaries.py

Layer stability order (higher number = more stable = fewer permitted dependencies):
  0 — Presentation  (least stable — depends on everything below)
  1 — API Surface
  2 — Runtime Core
  3 — Knowledge / Identity / Provider  (orthogonal stable leaves)
  4 — Storage Substrate
  5 — Constitution  (most stable — nothing depends on it)

Dependency rule: imports may only point FROM less stable layers TO more stable layers.
i.e., a file in layer N may import from layer N+1 or above (higher number = more stable),
never from layer N-1 or below (lower number = less stable).
Example: api (1) → kernel (2) is permitted. kernel (2) → api (1) is a violation.

Orthogonal layers (all at level 3) must not import from each other:
  knowledge <-> identity: forbidden
  knowledge <-> provider: forbidden
  identity  <-> provider: forbidden

# ── Architectural Debt Registry ───────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# This registry records known architectural violations that exist in the
# codebase. It does NOT grant permission for them. Every entry represents
# a liability: understood, scheduled for removal, and assigned to a workstream.
#
# Freeze rule: this registry may only be edited in two cases:
#   1. New debt is intentionally introduced — rare; requires ADR justification.
#   2. Existing debt is removed — because the underlying violation has been fixed.
#
# Do not add entries to avoid a failing test. If a test fails due to a new
# violation, the correct response is to fix the import, not to register it here.
# If deferral is genuinely necessary, document the reason in an ADR first.
#
# Format: (importer_prefix, imported_prefix, "description — workstream — exit criterion")
# Remove an entry only after the violation is resolved and the fix is merged.

    # canonical distributed key pool (api.key_pool.acquire_key), which already

    # ── Discovered during B0.5 calibration (2026-07-24) ─────────────────────

    # RESOLVED (Consolidation Pass 04, 2026-08-25): kernel/tts.py →
    # api.tts_key_manager. Fixed by dependency injection (ADR-014 Decision 4
    # pattern): api/main.py (composition root) injects the store accessors
    # into kernel.tts via kernel.tts.configure_key_store(); the kernel no
    # longer imports the api layer. Exit criterion met:
    # grep -n "from api" kernel/tts.py returns empty. This removes the last
    # detector-visible Layer-2→Layer-1 import in the codebase.

    # RESOLVED (Consolidation Pass 06, 2026-08-25): api/nodes.py → kernel.tools.
    # The only kernel use was len(list_tools()) for the tools_count field of
    # the public /api/codex/personal response — non-identity data, already
    # guarded by try/except with a default of 4. Removed by capability
    # injection: the composition root (api/knowledge_routes.wire_downstream_seams)
    # injects a () -> int counter via api.nodes.configure_tools_counter().
    # Without injection the fallback remains 4, identical to the previous
    # import-failure path. Identity semantics unchanged: no identity,
    # ownership, or request context ever crossed this boundary. Exit
    # criterion met: grep -n "from kernel" api/nodes.py returns empty. The
    # identity layer is now a true leaf.

    # Pass 07 reconciliation: api/main.py → solspire.console_router is NOT a
    # violation under the current layer model (solspire is layer 2, so
    # api(1)→solspire(2) is the permitted downward direction). Registry entry
    # retained for historical traceability only; the layer detector does not

    # same-layer). It remains a REGISTERED design debt per ADR-014 Decision 4:
    # providers should receive keys via injection rather than importing stores.

    # knowledge.db. The only knowledge use was a single persona system-prompt
    # lookup in _resolve_persona_prompt. Removed by dependency injection: the
    # composition root (api/knowledge_routes.wire_downstream_seams, called
    # from api/main.py) injects api.knowledge_routes.resolve_persona_system_prompt
    # into providers.router.configure_persona_resolver(). Without injection the
