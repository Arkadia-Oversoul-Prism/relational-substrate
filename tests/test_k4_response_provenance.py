"""K4 — Response Provenance.

Arkana must be able to show WHICH retrieved Knowledge OS notes informed a reply.
The invariant under test is provenance, not decoration:

    a source may be cited ONLY if its note was actually part of the context
    package that was injected into the provider for that turn.

The Gemini embedding API is unavailable in the test environment, so
embed_text / store_chunk_embedding are stubbed with deterministic local vectors
(same technique as tests/test_oracle_spine.py). This is strictly necessary to
exercise the REAL retrieval plumbing offline — chunk storage, thread filtering,
scoring, and format_context_for_provider all run unmodified.
