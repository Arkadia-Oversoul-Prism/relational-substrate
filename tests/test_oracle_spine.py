"""
Conversational Spine — continuity + thread-linkage tests.

Verifies the canonical invariant: ONE INTELLIGENCE SPINE, MANY INTERFACES.
Memory and intelligence must be interface-independent — a turn archived under
a session_id in one surface must be retrievable in a subsequent turn under
the SAME session_id, regardless of which surface initiated it.

The Gemini embedding API is not available in the test environment, so
embed_text / store_chunk_embedding are stubbed with deterministic local
vectors. This is strictly necessary to exercise the REAL retrieval plumbing
(chunk storage, thread_id filtering, cosine/BM25 scoring,
format_context_for_provider) offline. Every other code path runs unmodified.
