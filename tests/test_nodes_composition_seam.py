"""Architecture guard — api/nodes.py must not import the layer-1 surface.

api/nodes.py is layer-3 identity (ADR-015). It is composed with the A.I.S
profile and Engineering Lab routers, but must not import them directly: the
composition root injects them via ``api.nodes.configure_routers`` (ADR-014
Decision 4 — the same pattern used for the tools counter).

These tests exercise the real seam: the architectural invariant (AST, no
layer-1 import), the behavior (injected sub-routers actually serve), and the
truthfulness of the no-injection state (no fabricated routes).
