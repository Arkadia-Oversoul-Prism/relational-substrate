"""AGENTS.md encoding audit — decide a mojibake repair from the bytes, not prose.

The repository's ``AGENTS.md`` carries a pre-existing encoding defect and two
open pull requests disagreed about whether it is repairable. The disagreement
was not about taste; it was about whether one candidate recovery reproduces the
file's own last clean state. This script answers that with a byte oracle so the
answer survives a re-run and does not depend on a remembered codec table.

The defect
----------
Text that was once UTF-8 was written back as if the bytes were CP866: the
sequence ``U+2014`` (em dash) becomes the three characters ``U+0442 U+0410
U+0424``. The transform is applied **per line** and is exactly reversible:

    line.encode("cp866").decode("utf-8") == original_line

Only for *some* lines, though. A line that legitimately contains an em dash and
no mojibake is itself not CP866-decodable, so the round-trip raises and the line
is left alone. That is the classifier this script uses: a corrupted line is one
whose CP866 round-trip **succeeds**. The Cyrillic count is deliberately *not* the
discriminator — mojibake of ``U+00B7`` yields box-drawing characters with no
Cyrillic at all, and requiring Cyrillic to disappear silently skips those lines.

Decidability
------------
A candidate repair is correct when it satisfies all of:

1. applying the corruption transform to the repair returns the corrupted input
   on the corrupted domain, and
2. every line outside that domain is byte-identical, and
3. recovery introduces no new Latin-1 leftover relative to the oracle, and
4. the recovered text relates to the last clean revision by **insertions only** —
   no oracle line is replaced or deleted.

The last clause is the load-bearing one: the oracle predates later appended
sections, so prefix equality is the wrong test. Divergence in a byte that existed
before means recovery invented or dropped content.

The second clause is why this script never rewrites the whole file. A whole-file
``bytes.decode("cp866")`` is destructive: it raises on the genuine, un-corrupted
``U+2014``/``U+2192`` lines and, where it does not, rewrites them.

Usage
-----
    python scripts/agents_md_encoding_audit.py [--path AGENTS.md] [--json]

Exits 0 when the recovered text is verified against the byte oracle, 1 when the
input is already clean and the oracle **corroborates** it — consulted, and no
oracle line replaced or deleted — and 2 when recovery is not decidable. A file
can be free of mojibake and still diverge from the oracle, and reporting that as
verified-clean is the mis-diagnosis exit 1 exists to prevent; the absence of
Cyrillic is not on its own a clean bill of health.

``--shadow`` additionally handles the second corruption class: text that carries
one *further* outer re-encode pass on top of the CP866 defect. See
``audit_shadow`` for why the codec is proved rather than asserted.
